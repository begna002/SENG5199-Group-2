## James's screen
James's screen is only accessible to authorized users. You are an authorized user, right?
This screen contains a text box that allows for up to 8 characters to be entered. The screen
will then show a scrollable column of all anagrams of the input string. Navigating back to the
home screen from this screen will show a warning message, just in case an unauthorized user
somehow stumbled onto my screen. User authentication is currently TODO.
