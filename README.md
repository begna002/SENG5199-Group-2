# SENG5199-Group-2

## James's screen
James's screen is only accessible to authorized users. You are an authorized user, right?
This screen contains a text box that allows for up to 8 characters to be entered. The screen
will then show a scrollable column of all anagrams of the input string. Navigating back to the
home screen from this screen will show a warning message, just in case an unauthorized user
somehow stumbled onto my screen. User authentication is currently TODO.

Feature: 
Users can enter events and display them in the events log with a nice UI. 
Users can delete events. 
Users can chat with an AI, the "Neighbors ChatBot," externally to inquire about future events of neighbors. 
Users can externally check Bassam's portfolio. 

Note: 
Editing Events/dialogue, search and rotation functionality are not supported in this version ;) "they are added for a better UI experience."
